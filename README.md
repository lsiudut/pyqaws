# pyqaws

Simple application to manage multiple AWS accounts. Currently only Read-Only mode is allowed and but once I find some time this will change.

## Configuration

Simple edit config.cfg file. Sample is provided. You can add more sections, accounts will be displayed in separated tabs.

```ini
[Account no 1]
aws_aki = access_key_here
aws_sak = secret_access_key_here
region = eu-west-1

[Account no 2]
aws_aki = access_key_here
aws_sak = secret_access_key_here
region = eu-west-1
```
